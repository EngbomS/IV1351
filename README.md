# IV1351
Course work for
IV1351, Data Storage Paradigms, the course provides an in-depth understanding of various data storage models and techniques. Students learn about relational databases, conceptual modeling, SQL, and the integration of databases with applications. 
This repository includes the following files:

   Task_1: This document details the initial phase of the project, focusing on the conceptual modeling of the database. It includes Entity-Relationship diagrams and descriptions of the entities and relationships identified for the Soundgood Music School.

   Task_2: This file presents the logical design of the database, translating the conceptual model into a relational schema. It outlines the tables, attributes, primary and foreign keys, and normalization processes applied to ensure data integrity and efficiency.

   Task_3: This report covers the implementation phase, detailing the creation of the database using SQL. It includes the SQL scripts used to create tables, insert data, and establish constraints, as well as sample queries demonstrating the functionality of the database.


The project undertaken in this course involves developing a database system for the Soundgood Music School. The objective is to facilitate efficient information handling and business transactions by designing a robust database and an accompanying application to manage operations. The project is divided into multiple tasks, each building upon the previous to achieve a comprehensive solution.

This project was developed as part of the IV1351 course at KTH Royal Institute of Technology. We acknowledge the course instructors and teaching assistants for their guidance and support throughout the project.
